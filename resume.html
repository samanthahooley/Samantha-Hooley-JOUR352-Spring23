        <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Guest Lead Manager</h3>
            <h4>Altar’d State</h4>
            <h5>June 2022 - Present</h5>
        <p>I manage a team of sales associates at the retail company Altar’d State. I ensure an exceptional guest experience by assisting guests while they shop, design outfits, and allow quick and smooth transactions. It is also my responsibility to convert guests and drive our daily dollar per transaction (DPT) goal and achieve my own personal sales-per-hour (SPAH) goal. I also assist in the operations of the store. This includes opening and closing operations, tracking daily sales plans, executing damages, overseeing markdowns and training new managers and sales associates. </p>
        
            <h3>Brand Representative</h3>
            <h4>Altar'd State</h4>
            <h5> November 2021 - June 2022</h5>
        <p>As a brand representative my main goal was to greet and assist guests while they shop. Building large sales was expected as well as understanding current fashion trends and helping to design outfits. I also ensured quick and smooth transactions.</p>
            <h3>Staff Writer</h3>
            <h4>The Campus Trainer</h4>
            <h5>Spring 2022 - Present</h5>
        <p>As a staff writer I attend pitch meetings and pick a weekly beat to write about. I execute interviews, reporting and research to gain insight to the beat and formulate an article that demonstrates the information obtained through the interviews and research. I write mostly for the Love & Life, Fashion, and Fitness & Wellness sections.</p>
        
            <h3>Pet-Sitter and Child Caregiver</h3>
            <h4>Self- Employed</h4>
            <h5>May 2021 - Present</h5>
        <p>As a pet-sitter I ensure the animal's safety and relaxation. I also make sure they get fed at appropriate times and have access to clean water. I walk and play with the dog to ensure good health and house-sit while the pet relaxes.<br>As a child caregiver I ensure the child/children are safe and watch them responsibly. It is also crucial to feed the child healthy meals and make myself aware of any allergies the child may have and ensure exceptional hygiene.
